# Numba-CUDA-MLIR

Numba-CUDA-MLIR provides a programming model similar to CUDA C++ in Python. It
is evolved from [Numba-CUDA](https://github.com/NVIDIA/numba-cuda), and is
intended to be compatible with Numba-CUDA kernels.

Numba-CUDA-MLIR aims to interoperate well with existing programming models
whilst also allowing experts sufficient control over code generation.


## Quick Start

Install with pip:

```
pip install numba-cuda-mlir[cu13]  # or [cu12] if using CUDA 12
```

Writing and executing a simple vector add kernel:

```python
import numpy as np
from numba_cuda_mlir import cuda

@cuda.jit
def vector_add(a, b, out):
    i = cuda.grid(1)
    if i < out.shape[0]:
        out[i] = a[i] + b[i]

n = 1_000_000
a = np.ones(n, dtype=np.float32)
b = np.ones(n, dtype=np.float32)
out = np.zeros(n, dtype=np.float32)

threads_per_block = 256
blocks = (n + threads_per_block - 1) // threads_per_block
vector_add[blocks, threads_per_block](a, b, out)
```


## Migration from Numba / Numba-CUDA

Change imports to use the `numba_cuda_mlir.cuda` package instead of
`numba.cuda`. For example:

```python
from numba import cuda
```

becomes:

```python
from numba_cuda_mlir import cuda
```

For the majority of code using Numba-CUDA, this should be a sufficient change to
enable the use of Numba-CUDA-MLIR. For code using the extension APIs,
modifications will be required as Numba-CUDA-MLIR uses MLIR in its code
generation process instead of LLVM IR. See the Migration Guidance in the
documentation for further details.
